Oh! darling, please believe me 
I'll never do you no harm 
Believe me when I tell you 
I'll never do you no harm 
      
Oh! Darling, if you leave me 
I'll never make it alone 
Believe me when I tell you, ooo 
Don't ever leave me alone 

When you told me 
You didn't need me anymore 
Well you know I nearly broke down and cried 
When you told me 
you didn't need me anymore 
Well you know I nearly broke down and died 

Oh! Darling if you leave me 
I'll never make it alone 
Believe me when I tell you 
I'll never do you no harm 
(Believe me darling) 

When you told me 
You didn't need me anymore 
Well you know I nearly broke down and cried 
When you told me 
you didn't need me anymore 
Well you know I nearly broke down and died 

Oh! Darling, please believe me 
I'll never let you down 
Oh, believe me darling 
Believe me when I tell you, ooo 
I'll never do you no harm
