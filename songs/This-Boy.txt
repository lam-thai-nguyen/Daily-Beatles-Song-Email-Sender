THIS BOY

Appears on album: Past Masters Volume 1

Year released: 1988

That boy took my love away 
Oh, he'll regret it some day 
But this boy wants you back again 
      
That boy isn't good for you 
Though he may want you too 
This boy wants you back again 

Oh, and this boy would be happy 
Just to love you, but oh, my, oh 
That boy won't be happy 
till he's seen you cry 

This boy wouldn't mind the pain 
Would always feel the same 
If this boy gets you back again 

This boy, this boy...
