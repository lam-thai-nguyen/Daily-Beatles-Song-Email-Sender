Cry baby cry 
make your mother sigh 
She's old enough to know better 
      
The King of Marigold was in the kitchen 
cooking breakfast for the queen 
The queen was in the parlor playing piano 
for the children of the king 
Cry baby cry 
make your mother sigh 
She's old enough to know better 
So cry baby cry 
The King was in the garden picking flowers 
for a friend who came to play 
The queen was in the playroom painting pictures 
for the children's holiday 
Cry baby cry 
make your mother sigh 
She's old enough to know better 
So cry baby cry 
The Duchess of Kircaldy always smiling 
and arriving late for tea 
The duke was having problems with a message 
at the local Bird and Bee 
Cry baby cry 
make your mother sigh 
She's old enough to know better 
So cry baby cry 
At twelve o'clock a meeting 'round the table 
for a seance in the dark 
With voices out of nowhere put on specially 
by the children for a lark 
Cry baby cry 
make your mother sigh 
She's old enough to know better 
So cry baby cry 
Cry, cry, cry baby 
make your mother sigh 
She's old enough to know better 
Cry baby cry 
cry, cry, cry 
make your mother sigh 
She's old enough to know better 
So cry baby cry
