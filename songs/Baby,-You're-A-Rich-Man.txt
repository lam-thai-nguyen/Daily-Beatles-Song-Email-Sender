How does it feel to be 
One of the beautiful people 
Now that you know who you are 
What do you want to be 
And have you traveled very far 
far as the eye can see 
      
How does it feel to be 
One of the beautiful people 
How often have you been there 
Often enough to know 
What did you see when you were there 
Nothing that doesn't show 
Baby you're a rich man 
Baby you're a rich man 
Baby you're a rich man, too 
You keep all your money in a big brown bag 
inside a zoo, what a thing to do 
Baby you're a rich man 
Baby you're a rich man 
Baby you're a rich man, too 
How does it feel to be 
One of the beautiful people 
Tuned to a natural E 
happy to be that way 
Now that you've found another key 
What are you going to play 
Baby you're a rich man 
Baby you're a rich man 
Baby you're a rich man, too 
You keep all your money in a big brown bag 
inside a zoo, what a thing to do 
Baby you're a rich man 
Baby you're a rich man 
Baby you're a rich man, too
