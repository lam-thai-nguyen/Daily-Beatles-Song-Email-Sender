I told you about strawberry fields 
You know the place where nothing is real 
Well here's another place you can go 
Where everything flows 
Looking through the bent backed tulips 
To see how the other half live 
Looking through a glass onion 
      
I told you about the walrus and me, man 
You know that we're as close as can be, man 
Well here's another clue for you all 
The walrus is Paul 
Standing on the cast iron shore, yeah 
Lady Madonna trying to make ends meet, yeah 
Looking through a glass onion 
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah 
Looking through a glass onion 
I told you about the fool on the hill 
I tell you man he's living there still 
Well here's another place you can be 
Listen to me 
Fixing a hole in the ocean 
Tryin' to make a dovetail joint 
Looking through a glass onion
