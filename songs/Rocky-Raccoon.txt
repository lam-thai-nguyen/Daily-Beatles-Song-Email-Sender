Now somewhere in the black mountain hills of Dakota, 
There lived a young boy named Rocky Raccoon(na) 
And one day his woman ran off with another guy 
Hit young Rocky in the eye 
Rocky didn't like that he said I'm gonna get that boy 
so one day he walked into town 
Booked himself a room in the local saloon 
      
Rock Raccoon checked into his room 
Only to find Gideon's bible 
Rocky had come equipped with the gun 
to shoot off the legs of his rival 
His rival it seems had broken his dreams 
By stealing the girls of his fancy 
Her name was Magill, and she called herself Lil 
But everyone knew her as Nancy 
Now she and her man who called himself Dan 
Were in the next room at the hoe-down 
Rocky burst in and grinning a grin 
He said Danny boy this is a show down 
Daniel was hot he drew first and shot 
And Rocky collapsed in the corner 
Da, da, da, da, da 
Now the doctor came in stinking of gin 
And proceeded to lie on the table 
He said Rocky you met your match 
And Rocky said, Doc it's only a scratch 
And I'll be better 
I'll be better doc as soon as I am able 
And now Rocky Raccoon he fell back in his room 
only to find Gideon's bible 
Gideon checked out and he left it no doubt 
To help with good Rocky's revival 
Ah, oh yeah, yeah 
Da, da, da, da
