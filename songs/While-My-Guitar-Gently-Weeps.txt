WHILE MY GUITAR GENTLY WEEPS

Appears on album: The Beatles (The White Album)

I look at you all see the love there that's sleeping 
While my guitar gently weeps 
I look at the floor and I see it need sweeping 
Still my guitar gently weeps 
      
I don't know why nobody told you 
how to unfold you love 
I don't know how someone controlled you 
they bought and sold you 

I look at the world and I notice it's turning 
While my guitar gently weeps 
With every mistake we must surely be learning 
Still my guitar gently weeps 

I don't know how you were diverted 
you were perverted too 
I don't know how you were inverted 
no one alerted you 

I look at you all see the love there that's sleeping 
While my guitar gently weeps 
I look at you all 
Still my guitar gently weeps 

Oh, oh, oh 
oh oh oh oh oh oh oh 
oh oh, oh oh, oh oh 
Yeah yeah yeah yeah 
yeah yeah yeah yeah
