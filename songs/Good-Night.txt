Now it's time to say good night 
good night sleep tight 
Now the sun turns out his light 
good night sleep tight 
Dream sweet dreams for me 
Dream sweet dreams for you 
      
Close your eyes and I'll close mine 
Good night sleep tight 
Now the moon begins to shine 
Good night sleep tight 
Dream sweet dreams for me 
Dream sweet dreams for you 
Mm, mm, mm 

Close your eyes and I'll close mine 
Good night sleep tight 
Now the sun turns out his light 
Good night sleep tight 
Dream sweet dreams for me 
Dream sweet dreams for you 
(Good night, good night everybody 
everybody everywhere, goodnight)
