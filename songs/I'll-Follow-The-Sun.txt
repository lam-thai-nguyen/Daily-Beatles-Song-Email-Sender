I'LL FOLLOW THE SUN

Appears on album: Beatles For Sale
Composed by: Lennon/McCartney
Year released: 1964

One day you'll look to see I've gone 
For tomorrow may rain, 
so I'll follow the sun 
      
Some day you'll know I was the one 
But tomorrow may rain, 
so I'll follow the sun 

And now the time has come 
and, my love, I must go 
And though I lose a friend 
In the end you will know, oh 

One day you'll find that I have gone 
But tomorrow may rain, 
so I'll follow the sun 
But tomorrow may rain, 
so I'll follow the sun 

And now the time has come 
and, my love, I must go 
And though I lose a friend 
In the end you will know, oh 

One day you'll find that I have gone 
But tomorrow may rain, 
so I'll follow the sun
